            The Pinot Noir Winery has been a family-owned winery since its
            founding in the late 1990s. The family of winemakers have passed
            down their winemaking knowledge and techniques from generation to
            generation, creating a winemaking tradition that continues to this
            day. The Pinot Noir Winery was founded by John Smith and his wife,
            Mary Smith.
          </p>
          <p class="about-us__text">
            The Smiths built the winery on a piece of land that John had
            purchased in the late 1990s. He cleared the land, planted the vines,
            and built the winery from the ground up. He also developed a unique
            method of winemaking that would become the hallmark of the Pinot
            Noir Winery. Now it is recognized by all wineries around the world.
          </p>
          <p class="about-us__text">
            John was a farmer and a winemaker, and Mary was a cook and baker.
            Together they recognized the potential of winemaking in the area and
            set out to create a winery that would produce high-quality wines.
          </p>
          <p class="about-us__text">
            Our winemaking method is based on European methods. We use natural
            fermentation methods and barrels to age the wine and indigenous
            grape varieties to make the wines, which give them a unique flavor
            profile.

                  Grape crushing and pressing is a process used to extract juice

                  The fermentation process begins with the crushing of the

                  and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.

                  Wine aging and bottling are two important steps in the

                  prepares it for storage or sale.
