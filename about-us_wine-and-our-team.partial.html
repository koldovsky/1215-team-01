                    John Smith opened his interest in wine more than fourteen years ago
                    working at a farm and in a wine bar.

                His urge to get closer to the action led him to Texas where he was
                inspired by the best winery owners and winemaking professionals while
                building and managing their wine programs for several local
                restaurants. Smith decided to deepen his interest in winemaking
                industry and gained a Certificate in Viticulture from the Santa Rosa
                Junior College. Next he pursued a degree in Enology, Plant Science,
                and Chemistry, and gained winemaking experience while also
                experimenting with his favorite wine in his own backyard project with
                his wife, Mary. Finally, he embarked upon an extensive search
                throughout the area for a suitable location to start a commercial
                vineyard. That was a foundation of the Pinot Noir Winery.
