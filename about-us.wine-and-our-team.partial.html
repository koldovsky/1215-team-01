          His urge to get closer to the action led him to Texas where he was
          inspired by the best winery owners and winemaking professionals while
          building and managing their wine programs for several local
          restaurants. Smith decided to deepen his interest in winemaking
          industry and gained a Certificate in Viticulture from the Santa Rosa
          Junior College. Next he pursued a degree in Enology, Plant Science,
          and Chemistry, and gained winemaking experience while also
          experimenting with his favorite wine in his own backyard project with
          his wife, Mary. Finally, he embarked upon an extensive search
          throughout the area for a suitable location to start a commercial
          vineyard. That was a foundation of the Pinot Noir Winery.
